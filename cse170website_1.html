    <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"> scenic beauty, the F1 track and the riches</span>, it was simply mesmerizing. I wish I could watch the <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Monaco Grand Prix</span> there, would've been a once in a lifetime experience.</p>

    <h4>Travel Tips</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Monaco is known for its hilly terrain, so wear comfortable shoes for walking. I got mine from <a href="https://www.on.com/en-us/products/cloudmonster-2-m-3me1012/mens/black-frost-shoes-3ME10121197">ON</a>.</li>
    <li>Respect the Royal Family and avoid making jokes about the royal family, and if you encounter them, use the proper respectful greeting. </li>
    <li>Always carry a copy of your photo ID or your passport for security purposes. </li>
    </ol>
